# How to run inference with pretrained models

1. Download the compressed file containing all fold's checkpoint
2. Install the model by running the following command:
```commandline
conflunet_install_pretrained_model_from_zip PATH/TO/MODEL_EXPORT.zip
```
3. Use the `conflunet_predict` command to run inference (refer to the [usage instructions](how_to_use_conflunet.md) for a more detailed explanation)
